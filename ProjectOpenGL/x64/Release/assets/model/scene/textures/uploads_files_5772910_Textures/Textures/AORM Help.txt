I have included an AORM
This is a texture that combines
Ambient occlusion, roughness and
metallic into one map.

AORM are usually used to save space and have a more optimal workflow
when importing game assets.

Red = Ambient Occlusion
Green = Roughness
Blue = Metallic

In blender you can use a seperate colour
node to split the channels and then plug in the 
coloured corrosponding colour pin into the shader.

In unreal engine plug in the already exposed corrosponding
colour pins into the shader from the texture.
